| October 31 | 11:00-11:45pm | I discussed the merits of different algorithms and data structures with other students in class. We settled on precomputing a table where we hash all the keys and store the key-value pairs in a map of lists together with all other key-value pairs with the same hash. Then, when checking the values of specific keys, we can use the map to get a lookup for all vey-value pairs with the same hash in constant time, then simply search that greatly reduced list. |

I used a Node class to store key-value pairs and a CollisionSet class to keep track of all the Nodes that have the same hash as the target key. Giving a bunch of different errors. |

I fixed the bugs. The algorithm runs correctly, but slowly (I fail two of the test cases due to timing out, but if I increase the allotted time by modifying the tester file, I pass all four. |
